## Continuous Integration (CI)

This repository has continuous integration set up using GitHub Actions. This means that the automated tests are run automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository. You can view the results of the test runs in the "Actions" tab above. Feel free to explore the workflows and their execution details.

Additionally, you can also access the artifacts generated during the test runs, which include screenshots and videos captured during the test execution:

- **Screenshots**: Screenshots are automatically generated and stored only if an end-to-end (E2E) test fails. You can find the screenshots in the "Artifacts" section of the specific workflow run, under the "cypress-screenshots" artifact.

- **Videos**: Test run videos are always captured and stored as artifacts. You can access the test run videos in the "Artifacts" section of the workflow run, under the "cypress-videos" artifact.
